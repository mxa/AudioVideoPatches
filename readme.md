# Audio Video Pure Data Patches

These patches are designed to demonstrate techniques in Pure Data how to handle short audiovisual snippets with the maximum of control. For easier understanding they are organized in a ascending level of complexity. Most of them are making use of the Graphics Environment for Multimedia (GEM) library to display the moving images, but other ways to control video players from within Pd are also demonstrated.

For the moost part, these patches were made from 2009 on, with some additions in 2018.

The patches are copyleft by Max Neupert. Please use them as you please with or without attribution. Comments and additions are welcome though, please feel free to file an inssue here on github or drop me an email.
